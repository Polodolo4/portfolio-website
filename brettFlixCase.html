    <h2 class="meet-head">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This "BrettFlix" project serves as the client-side for an application based on my existing server-side "MyFlix API"
      project consisting of a REST API and database.
    </p>
    <h2 class="meet-head">Purpose and Context</h2>
    <p>
      This project is somewhat similar to websites such as "IMDB" that I completed as part of my Career Foundry course in Full-Stack Web Development.
    </p>
    <h2 class="meet-head">Objective</h2>
    <p>
      The goal for this project was to build upon a prior server-side project (MyFlix API) & develop the client-side to make this a fully functional application,
      which was accomplished by exposing me to a few new topics such as the Angular framework, TypeScript, & Angular Material. Key features with the app include a welcome view 
      allowing new users to register, or alternatively log in if already registered. From there, users can view all the movies in the database from my "MyFlix API" project, add/remove 
      them from their favorites, and open windows displaying more info about each movie's genre, director, & summary. Additionally, users can go to their profile and make changes, or delete
      their profile altogether.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2 class="meet-head">Duration</h2>
    <p>
      From start to finish (including TypeDoc documentation) this project took me 3 weeks to complete.
    </p>
    <h2 class="meet-head">Credits</h2>
    <p>
      My role was the lead developer on this project with the aid of my Career Foundry Tutor and Mentor.

      The project was built with the Angular framework, TypeScript (a new programming language for me at the time), and the Angular Material UI component library.

    <h3 class="middle-head">Project Process</h3>
    <p>
      First off, in a prior project for my CareerFoundry course I built out the server-side REST API for the application. The API was built using Node, Express, MongoDB Mongoose and deployed to Heroku. 
      <br>
      <div class="heroku-row">
        <div class="heroku-col">
          <img src="img/brettFlix/api1.png" class="API" alt="heroku">
        </div>
        <div class="heroku-col">
          <img src="img/brettFlix/heroku.png" class="heroku" alt="heroku">
        </div>
      </div>
      <br>
      With my server-side code intact from a prior project, I began working on the client-side. As this project was going to be developed using the Angular framework,
      I started off by creating a new app using the Angular CLI, and the necessary logic for making API calls. I then made dialog boxes for both the created user login
      component and user registration component and linking them with the “app.component.ts” root component and ensuring the proper response from my API was returned. 
      <br>
      <br>
      From there, I then built out a welcome page component where the user registration/login functionality would live, as well as building a user profile component
      allowing users to edit/view/delete their profile, & a movie card component that displays the movies on the main page after users login. The movie cards themselves
      contain buttons that display dialog boxes containing information about the movie’s director, genre, of a summary of the movie.
      <br>
      <div class="error-row">
        <div class="error-col">
          <img src="img/brettFlix/welcome.png" class="brett-app-screen" alt="serverless">
        </div>
        <div class="error-col">
          <img src="img/brettFlix/movie.png" class="brett-app-screen" alt="serverless">
        </div>
        <div class="error-col">
          <img src="img/brettFlix/profile.png" class="brett-app-screen" alt="serverless">
        </div>  
      </div>
      <br>
      Finally, I made the application responsive, finalized my CSS stylings of the application, applied a simple UI design using Angular Material, and documented my code using TypeDoc.
    </p>
    <h3 class="middle-head">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      This project was my first foray into Angular after a React heavy portion of my CareerFoundry course. While there were certainly some things I liked and things I did not like about
      Angular after spending a lot of time working with another framework, I ultimately ended up with a clean looking, well-functioning application that I’m proud of.
