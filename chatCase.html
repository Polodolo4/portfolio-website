        <h2 class="meet-head">Overview</h2>
        <p>
        My chat application is an application developed with React Native & designed to mimic other modern chat applications.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="meet-head">Purpose and Context</h2>
        <p>
         This application was completed for my CareerFoundry course to expose me to the world of mobile web development.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="meet-head">Objective</h2>
        <p>
        My objective for this application was to take tech previously unfamiliar to me such as React Native and Expo to learn
        to develop for the mobile space of tech.

    <h2 class="meet-head">Duration</h2>
    <p>
      This particular project took me a bit longer than it normally would have due to a slight problem with a dependency versioning issue, but I was able to complete it in about 5 weeks.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="meet-head">Credits</h2>
    <p>
      My role was the lead developer on this project with the aid of my CareerFoundry Tutor and Mentor.

    </div>
    <p>
      React Native was used to write the application, while Expo was used for development. The Chat app also makes use of Google
      Firestore Database, Google Firebase Authentication, & Firebase Cloud Storage.

    <h3 class="middle-head">Project Process</h3>
      <div class="post">
        <div class="post-text">
          <p>
            To begin this project, I installed and set up Expo/Expo Go so I could develop my project and see the changes made in real-time.
            I then built out the code for the separate "screens" I would need for the application, installed React Navigation, and set up a TouchableOpacity wrapper to allow users to navigate between said screens.
            Also installed was Gifted Chat to handle much of the chat functionality of the application, and I implemented code to make use of the
            KeyboardAvoidingView component to ensure the input field won't be hidden beneath the keyboard on any smaller screened devices.
            <br>
            <br>
            Next up was installing Firebase, as well as getting my Google Firestore Database set up for the application to handle the messaging and media storage. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="fire-image">
          <img src="img/chatCase/fire-screen.png" class="fire-screen" alt="firebase screenshot">
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="chat-screens">
        <div class="chat-screens-img">
          <img src="img/chatCase/messages.png" class="chat-bottom" alt="serverless">
        </div>
        <div class='chat-screens-text'>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
            I then installed AsyncStorage to store messages locally, as well as set Firestore to disable when there is no network connection. 
            From there, I added code so the messages would display from Firestore when it's active, & from cached messages when not active.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
            Lastly, I added an ActionSheet to the chat screen giving users the options to choose a photo from their existing photos, take a new photo,
            send their location, or cancel.
          </p>
        </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
    
      <div class="chat-screens-img">
          <img src="img/chatCase/actions.png" class="chat-bottom" alt="serverless">
      </div>
      

      </div>

    <br>
    <h3 class="middle-head">Challenges</h3>
    <p>
      The most difficult challenge I faced was getting my Firestore Database connected properly with my application. At the time, a newer version of Firebase had just come out, while my coding course curriculum 
      was still using an older version. Neither of these versions were working and so I meticulously read through the documentation for the newer version, which ultimately didn't work out either. In the end, through
      some perseverance and assistance from my CareerFoundry tutor, I was able to find a version that would function within my app. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="middle-head">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      This was one of my more enjoyable projects that I completed for CareerFoundry, outside of the Firebase versioning headache that is! I really enjoyed working with React Native's components
      and the mobile side of development in general.
